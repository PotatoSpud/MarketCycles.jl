# MarketCycles

This package provides digital signal processing indicators developed by John F. Ehlers.

Currently the original indicators shared in his book: Cycle Analytics for Traders, Advanced Technical Trading Concepts are provided with intent to explore the DSP space and provide new intuitions based on the Ehlers framework. 

Outside contributions are welcome!
